# Game-Selector
By Sage Derby

This app is used to select games and add their application path into the system to be selected later. A fun side project I worked on durring school.
To start, install unity edition 2022.3.5. Then open the application at "...\SteamGameSelector\Assets\Player Controller\Scenes\Player Controller Scene.unity". From there, press the play icon on the top to start the application. 

I couldn't figure out how to get the application itself on github, especially with it being over 25 megabytes.
